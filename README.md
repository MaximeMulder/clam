# What is this ?

This is Clam ! A small statically typed functional programming language with a C-family syntax and numerous type features.

I developped this interpreter while my master's thesis was being evaluated. I made it to learn OCaml, practice functional programming, and apply some of the knowledge I gained about types and type theory.

# Examples

A Clam program is a sequence of type definitions (declared with `type`) and expression definitions (declared with `def`). The order of these definitions is unimportant.

When a program is executed, the `main` expression definition is evaluated. Printing can be done through the `print` function, which can be chained with other expressions in a block.

```
def fibonacci: (Int) -> Int = (n) ->
    if n == 0 | n == 1 then
        n
    else
        fibonacci(n - 2) + fibonacci(n - 1);

def main = {
    print(fibonacci(2));
    print(fibonacci(5));
};
```

More examples of Clam code can be found in the `tests` directory.

# How to build

You can build this project on Linux using Dune !

Simply enter `dune build` to build to build the project or `dune exec clam filename.clam` to run the project with the code file `filename.clam` as an input.

# Features

Most of the interesting things about Clam are in its type system, which while not very original, incorporates many ideas notably of System $F^Ï‰_{<:}$.

## Structural typing

Clam features a structural type system, meaning that two structurally equivalent types are considered the same.

```
type A = (Int, Int);
type B = (Int, Int);

def main = {
    var a: A = @(0, 0);
    var b: B = a;
};
```

## Subtyping

Clam features subtyping, meaning that a value may belong to several types and that some types may be considered to be more specific versions of other types.

```
type A = {x: Int, y: Int};

def main = {
    var a: A = @{x = 0, y = 0, z = 0};
};
```

## Top type

Clam has a top type named `Any`, which is a supertype of all types.

## Type operators

Clam features type operators, which allow to abstract over a type using other types. Type parameters have a bound, which is `Any` by default.

```
type Pair = [T] => (T, T);

def main = {
    var a: Pair[Int] = @(0, 0);
};
```

Type parameters cannot be of a higher kind yet.

## Universal types

Clam features universal types, which allow to abstract over an expression using types.

```
def map_pair = [T, U] -> (p: (T, T), f: (T) -> U) ->
    @(f(p.0), f(p.1));

def main = {
    var pair = @(2, 3);
    var double = map_pair[Int, Int](pair, (x) -> x * 2);
};
```

## Union and intersection types

Clam features union and intersection types.

```
type A = {a: Int} | {a: String};
type B = {a: Int} & {b: String};

def main = {
    var a: A = @{a = 1};
    var b: B = @{a = 2, b = "World"};
};
```

## Bidirectional type inference

Clam features bidirectional type inference, which allows to eliminate many type annotations when they are not needed.

```
type Pair = [T] => (T, T);
type Make = [T] -> (T) -> Pair[T];

def make: Make = [T] -> (p) -> @(p, p);

def main = {
    var pair = make[Int](0, 0);
};
```

## Recursive types

Clam does not feature recursive types yet, which is kind of a bummer.

# Notes

I find the syntax of Clam to be kind of meh, and it also lacks many important features. However, this is more intended to be a fun side project rather than a usable programming language.

There are probably a few bugs in the program, notably when dealing with unions and intersections equivalence. Type errors are not tested yet so a few of them might have escaped me.

If I have enough time, I will probably improve this project in the future.
